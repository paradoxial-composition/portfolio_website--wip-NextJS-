export const AboutMe = `In 2018, I first encountered ES6 and frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. I was amazed by the fluidity and simplicity of their code, as well as the vast potential they offered despite their relatively low learning curve. This discovery sparked my interest, and I began familiarizing myself with both ReactJS and VueJS. Shortly after, I secured my first internship in the field I wanted to build my career around.

Thanks to my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new environments, I seamlessly integrated into my first team. In fact, I was even assigned to the team working on the agency's largest project at the time. This experience marked the beginning of my journey as a dedicated JavaScript web developer. Since then, I have been continuously exploring new technologies to experiment with and seeking interesting projects to bring to life.
