export const AboutMe = `I first encoutered ES6 and the existense of frameworks like reactjs and vuejs in 2018 and was astonished by the fluidity and the simplicity of its code,
and the projetc potential it has with that low learning curb, i was able to familiarise my self a bit with ract and vue and managed to get my first internship
to what i wanted to build my career on, thanks to my fast learning and adaptive skills I didnÂ´t find any issues while merging with the team, and was even put on the team
that was working on the biggest project the agency had at that time. From then, my journey as an avide JS web developper began, looking for cool new stuff to experiment with
and intresting projects to build.`
